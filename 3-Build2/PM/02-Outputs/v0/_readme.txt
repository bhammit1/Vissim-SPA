Once a model is run through Python, the model and the RBCs are copied into this Outputs folder.

Additional Things in this folder:
* Vissim Results Database
* Vissim Results ATT files
* MOE Spreadsheet

* Transit Travel Time/Dwell Time (when applicable)

Do not run the models through this folder, it will delete the results.
