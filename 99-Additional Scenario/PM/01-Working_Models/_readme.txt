Use this folder to save all "working models".

When running a Vissim model to review/debug - watch from this folder (run risk of deleting results if run through Outputs folder). 
* RBCGUI.exe > This will allow you to edit RBCs outside of Vissim

Highly encourage regular version control, saving-as to a new version number each time the model is run.

Once a model is run through Python, the model and the RBCs are copied into the Outputs folder. Therefore, you do not need to save those models in this folder as well.
