This folder contains the project-specific LAYX (layout) files that the python script uses to pull out the ATT files from Vissim automatically. 

**Outputs > this file is set up with all output results files desired WITH the "AutoSave" checked.
**Outputs - Post Run > this file is exactly the same WITHOUT the "AutoSave" checked. This should enable you to open the model from the outputs folder without saving the ATT files each time.
